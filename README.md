Frikinzi's Fauna (for 1.12.2 and 1.16.5) adds a variety of real life animals to Minecraft that are not usually found in other animal mods with a focus on avian and water creatures. You can find many of these animals while exploring the jungles, forests, tundras, wastelands, and coasts in your Minecraft world. Discover sparrows in the trees, golden eagles ruling the mountains, colorful crabs on the beach, and a variety of fish swimming in rivers and oceans.
