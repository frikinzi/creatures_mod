Welcome to the official repository for Frikinzi's Fauna! 

Frikinzi's Fauna (for 1.12.2 and 1.16.5) is the ultimate bird and fish mod that adds over 50+ realistic animals to your Minecraft world. You can find many of these animals while exploring the jungles, forests, tundras, wastelands, and coasts in your Minecraft world. Discover sparrows in the trees, golden eagles ruling the mountains, colorful crabs on the beach, and a variety of fish swimming in rivers and oceans. Learn more about these animals using the in-game guide.

For a full list of animals, see the Curseforge page or the wiki on the top right tab.
